# These are my Projects

## Heart Disease Prediction Using ML Techniques
> **Description:**  
> Applied multiple classifiers, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of 66% using the UCI dataset of 14 key attributes.  
> Explored feature importance to identify the most influential factors contributing to heart disease.  
> Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalization, to improve model performance.  
> Visualized results using confusion matrices and ROC curves for model evaluation.

## Rice Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow (TF)
> **Description:**  
> Enhanced model accuracy to 83% through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.  
> Built a custom CNN architecture tailored for rice leaf disease image classification.  
> Implemented early stopping and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.  
> Evaluated model performance on a separate test set and visualized predictions.

## PIA Passenger Sentiment Analysis using VADER
> **Description:**  
> Used the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool to analyze reviews: 15.3% positive, 11.0% negative, and 73.6% neutral.  
> Collected and preprocessed passenger feedback data from multiple sources.  
> Generated visual summaries such as pie charts and word clouds to present sentiment distribution.  
> Provided actionable insights to improve customer experience based on sentiment trends.

## Predicting Bank Customer Churn using Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGB)
> **Description:**  
> Used Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier and achieved an accuracy score of 86.78%.  
> Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns related to customer churn.  
> Engineered new features to enhance predictive power and model interpretability.  
> Deployed the model as a web application for real-time churn prediction and reporting.
